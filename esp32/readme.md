#### ESP32 firmware

The code for the ESP32 is written within the VisualGDB IDE which is a plugin for MS Visual Studio. You can buy this software from <https://visualgdb.com> for a price of about $100. I'm using this IDE for all my projects like **nRF52xxx**, all **ARM** and of course **ESP32**. It just makes your life so much easier when you have professional tools which can use a JTAG probe and do real time debugging.
