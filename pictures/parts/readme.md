## Soldering Reflow Oven

### Hereâ€™re the important parts I used:

#### Controller - ESP32-NodeMCU

I got those from China quite some time ago and can't recall from where exactly, but any ESP32 module should work for that purpose. The difference to the ESP32-DevKitC from ESPRESSIF is the additional blue LED which is connected to GPIO2.

#### Temperature sensor -  MAX6675 Type K Thermocouple

Those modules coming normally with a sensor which is encased in a screw looking housing. I decided not to use the original sensors because of their high inertia on temperature changes. To get the best possible sensor dynamic I used sensors without any housing.

#### Front Status LED - APA102C

Since the machine itself don't have any display or buttons I decidedt to utilize some APA102C LED's which i had laying around from another project. Those LED communicating with a SPI inteface which makes them perfect for this application.
